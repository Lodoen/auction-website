## Description

This breif was assigned to me as the second semester project during my Front-End studies. The breif was described as follows:

"*An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings*".

<br />

I decided to target the website at electronics. The idea is that the website is a place where users can log in to auction their old electronics, or bid on other users auctions.

<br />

The project consists of 6 pages:
- A home page where users can view / filter auction listings
- A listing page showing the details of the selected listing
  - An unregistered user can view listing details
  - A registered user can make a bid
- A create auction page where users can create a new auction
- A profile page where users can edit their profile icon
- A register page where the user can create a new account
- A login page where a user can log in to their account

<br />

The following user stories were required by the breif:
- [x] A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- [x] A registered user may login
- [x] A registered user may logout
- [x] A registered user may update their avatar
- [x] A registered user may view their total credit
- [x] A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
- [x] A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing
- [x] A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
- [x] An unregistered user may search through Listings

<br />

Additionally I implemented:
- Ability to edit / delete auction listings
- Ability to view auction listings / bids made by a user
- A functional media gallery on the listing page

<br />
